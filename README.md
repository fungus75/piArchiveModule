# piArchiveModule
Opensource Clone of the SAP PI Archiving Module

This is a reproduction of the SAP Standard Archiving module, as shown in 
https://help.sap.com/viewer/22e34f550ba84f20b35b7652ba94ef9c/1.0.5/en-US/ce5c9a811c25452681888ddb139b2702.html 

As long as this adapter belongs to the B2B-Plugin I have created this open-source-version.



This  module should behave pretty much the same except the parameter removeErroneous was not implemented.

To deploy this module to a SAP PI System you have to install NWDS in that version your PI is and follow this
documentation to generate the neccessary ECB:
